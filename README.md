# About Me

🚀 Hi there! I'm a sales veteran with over 5 years of experience, who's currently pivoting into the field of data science. My tool belt includes Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter), SQL, Excel, and Tableau. I'll be graduating in June 2023 and ready to tackle my first data job!

📊 I love data because it allows me to use my creativity to solve real-world problems. It fulfills my need to help people and make use of my creativity. Plus, there's always something new to learn in this field!

📝 I'll be adding more projects to my GitHub over time. Feel free to check out my LinkedIn for my full professional profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-y-41789946/). And don't be shy and come say hi! Any constructive feedback is always welcome!

🤓 Thanks for stopping by !
